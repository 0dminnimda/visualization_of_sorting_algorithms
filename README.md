# Visualization of sorting algorithms

![hi ;)](merge_sort.png)

I made this project because I wanted to know more about the sorts, and I also like to visualize things. This way, itâ€™s easier to see how everything works.

## Installation

Clone the repo, open console in the root folder and run

```console
$ pip install .
```

## Examples

See [pygame_example.py](pygame_example.py)
